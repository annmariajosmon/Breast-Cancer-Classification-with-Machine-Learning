# Breast-Cancer-Classification-with-Machine-Learning

This repository contains a machine learning project that focuses on the classification of breast cancer using the Wisconsin breast cancer diagnostic dataset from scikit-learn. The project aims to help in the early diagnosis of breast cancer by utilizing machine learning techniques to analyze and predict whether a given breast mass is malignant or benign.

Workflow:

1.Data Preprocessing:
  Import and clean the dataset, removing any missing values.
  Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
  
2.Training the Model:
  Choose a machine learning algorithm and train the model using the training dataset.
  Optimize hyperparameters to achieve the best model performance.
  Save the trained model for future predictions.
  
3.Evaluation:
  Evaluate the model's performance on the testing dataset.
  Calculate key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  
4.Prediction:
  Load the pre-trained model.
  Use the model to make predictions on new data samples.
  Analyze the model's predictions for breast cancer classification.
